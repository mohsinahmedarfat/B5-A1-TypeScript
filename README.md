## 1. What are some differences between `interfaces` and `types` in TypeScript?

### Type
Type is more flexible and can represent a variety of types, not just objects. With `type`, it can define unions, intersections, and even alias primitive types.

### Union Types with Type
For instance, `type` allows for union types, which is something interfaces cannot handle.
``` TypeScript
type Id = string | number;
```

### Type Declaration Restrictions
Unlike interfaces, types do not support declaration merging. Attempting to redeclare a type will cause an error.
``` TypeScript
type User = {
    name: string;
};

// Error: Duplicate identifier 'User'
type User = {
    age: number;
}
```

### Type Composition
`type` is also ideal for composing new types from existing ones, making it a powerful tool for defining complex data structures.
``` TypeScript
type User = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    address: string;
};

type PartialUser = Partial<User>;
const partialUser: PartialUser = {
    name: 'Gerald',
    age: 30
};

type NameOnly = Pick<User, 'name'>;
const nameOnly: NameOnly = {
    name: 'Gerald'
};
```

### Interface
`Interface` allows you to define object shapes in a straightforward way and provides a first-class construct for creating reusable, extendable object types.

### Basic Interface Example
``` TypeScript
interface Car {
    brand: string;
    color: string;
}
```

### Interface Inheritance
One of the main strengths of interfaces is inheritance. An interface can extend other interfaces, making it easy to build on existing structures.

``` TypeScript
interface Person {
    name: string;
}

interface User extends Person {
    age: number;
}

const user: User = { name: 'Gerald', age: 30 };
```

### Interface for Classes
Interfaces are also a great choice for defining the structure or "contract" of a class, specifying the methods and properties a class should have.
``` TypeScript
interface Printable {
    print: () => void;
}

class Cart implements Printable {
    print() {
        console.log('Item has been added.');
    }
}
```

### Interface Declaration Merging
Interfaces can be merged—when multiple interfaces with the same name are declared in the same scope, they merge into one. This can be helpful, but overusing it can lead to complexity.
``` TypeScript
interface User {
    name: string;
}

interface User {
    age: number;
}

const user: User = { name: 'Gerald', age: 30 };
```
**Note:** Use declaration merging cautiously. Excessive merging can make interfaces hard to understand and debug due to unintended side effects.


## When Should We Use Each?
- Use `interface` when defining the structure of objects and classes, as they offer better flexibility with inheritance and work seamlessly with TypeScript’s type-checking.
- Use `type` for unions, intersections, primitive type aliases, or when you need to create complex, reusable types.

## Conclusion
Both `interface` and `type` bring valuable capabilities to TypeScript. By understanding the strengths of each, you can choose the right tool for every situation, making your code cleaner, more understandable, and easier to maintain.

## 2. Explain the difference between `any`, `unknown`, and `never` types in TypeScript.
TypeScript offers a robust type system, but certain types can be confusing, namely `any`, `unknown`, and `never`. Let's break them down for better understanding.

### The `any` Type
The `any` type is the simplest of the three. It essentially disables type checking, allowing a variable to hold any type of value. For example:
``` TypeScript
let value: any;
value = 42;             // number
value = "Hello";        // string
value = [1, 2, 3];      // array
value = () => {};       // function
value = { key: "val" }; // object
value = new Date();     // date
```
In all these cases, TypeScript does not raise any errors, allowing us to perform any operation on the variable without type constraints. This can be useful when migrating a JavaScript project to TypeScript. However, relying on `any` negates the benefits of type safety, making it a poor choice in most cases. Instead, consider using unknown.

### The `unknown` Type
The `unknown` type is safer than `any` because it requires type checks before performing operations. It represents the set of all possible values, but with type safety enforced.
``` TypeScript
let value: unknown;
value = 42;
value = "Hello";

// To perform operations, we need to narrow down the type
if (typeof value === "number") {
  console.log(value + 1); // TypeScript knows value is a number here
}
```
Using `unknown` is beneficial for functions that accept any type of input, like logging functions, as it enforces type checks before proceeding with operations.

### The `never` Type
The `never` type represents the empty set of values, indicating that something should never occur. No value can be assigned to a `never` type, making it useful for exhaustive checks and representing unreachable code.
``` TypeScript
type User = { type: "admin" } | { type: "standard" };

function handleUser(user: User) {
  switch (user.type) {
    case "admin":
      // handle admin
      break;
    case "standard":
      // handle standard
      break;
    default:
      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = user;
      // This ensures all cases are handled
  }
}
```
If a new user type is added, TypeScript will raise an error, ensuring that all cases are addressed, making `never` invaluable for maintaining exhaustive checks in your code.

## Conclusion
Understanding `any`, `unknown`, and `never` enhances TypeScript's type safety. Use `any` sparingly, preferring `unknown` for safer type checks, and leverage `never` for exhaustive checks and unreachable code. These types, when used correctly, make TypeScript a powerful tool for building reliable applications.
